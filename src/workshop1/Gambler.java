		/*Created Class Gambler and taken variables stake and bet with values.
		 * The currency is in Dollars ($)
		 * Created an IF Condition for probability.
		 * If random more than 1 it add up to stake, less than 1 it subtracts form stake.
		 * Created a FOR loop to check for a N number of Days.
		 * Created 2 variables gain and loss to add or sub stake value for iteration.
		 * Created a WHILE loop and inserted all If Condition in That.
		 * Created another IF condition to break the stake value at either gain or loss a 50%.
		 * Created new variables month,monthDays and  a new String monthName
		 * All monthDays were assigned to months.
		 * Created a Switch case for selecting each monthDays and monthName.
		 * In FOR loop the days were proportional to monthDays.
		 * Created other new variables lucky,nLucky,LuckDay,UnLuckDay.
		 * Created two public Variables isLucky,isUnLucky.
		 * Created another IF condition for storing max or min value of stake won.
		 * Printing the max gain or max loss of the whole Month
